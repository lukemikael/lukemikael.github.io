We submitted the Office Order of the reconstituted CART Committee and its Directory last February 2024. Last March 2024, we were also able to submit our Citizen’s Charter (CC) and Certificate of Compliance (COC)(.\n \nOn April 25, 2024, the CART Secretariat accessed the link provided in Advisory No. 19 Series of 2024 for the submission of our Client Satisfaction Measurement Report for 2023. The Secretariat failed to complete the submission as it appears that in addition to the Report itself, a sample size calculator and sample harmonized tool are required as well.\n \nPhilSA started the implementation of its client satisfaction measurement mechanisms in 2023. There was no Agency Action Plan for FY 2022 and the Citizen’s Charter was only completed this March 2024. Before the CC and COC submission, PhilSA had already been providing image-related services to external clients and IT-related services to internal clients, with both services being delivered mostly electronically. Feedback forms have been created for these services and distributed to clients after the completion of each service. However, despite our constant requests, most of our clients do not fill out these forms.\n  \nDue to the low response rate, we used the actual number of responses and clients in computing the overall rating instead of using a sample size. It is for this reason that we are unable to submit the file as required in the link provided.\n\nHence, we are submitting this letter instead of the sample size calculator.\n  \nThank you!\n","Sector":"National Government Agency","Telephone No.":"+63285689931","Timestamp":"2024-04-30 11:40:23.232000","Type of Submission":"NOT UNIFIED","Unnamed: 1":"Philippine Space Agency (PhilSA)","Unnamed: 18":null,"Unnamed: 19":"By checking this box, I hereby understand that I am afforded certain rights and protection according to RA 10173.","Unnamed: 20":"NATIONAL CAPITAL REGION (NCR)","Unnamed: 21":"Quezon City","Unnamed: 22":null,"Unnamed: 23":"PhilSA","Unnamed: 24":"Dr. Joel Joseph S.

On 24 June 2024, PhilSA’s Committee on Anti-Red Tape received an email from your Compliance Monitoring and Evaluation Office containing the subsequent findings of their assessment of PhilSA's CSMR for C.Y. 2023: \n\n1. The CSMR did not include the results of the questions related to the Citizen’s Charter awareness, visibility and helpfulness; \n\n2. PhilSA employed a different computation in measuring its CSM results; \n\n3. PhilSA’s CSM uses a five-point rating scale instead of a 100-point rating as required under ARTA Memorandum Circular 2023-05; \n\n4. The CSMR failed to include the overall Service Quality Dimension (SQD) results for each service offered by the agency; \n\n5. The CSMR failed to include a summary of the SQD 1-8 results; and \n\n6. The CSMR did not include the overall satisfaction of the SDQ 0. \n\nIn compliance thereto, we are resubmitting the CSMR reflecting the required data and results through the designated submission portal. Accordingly, we have revised our previous submission to comply with this request.  \n\nHowever, we are respectfully requesting for the kind consideration of your Office and allow modifications on CSMR and consider our submission as sufficient compliance to your requirements. Specifically, we pray that the following findings be reconsidered: \n\n1. Finding no. 1 on the inclusion of results of the questions related to the Citizen’s Charter awareness, visibility and helpfulness. PhilSA may not be able to address this finding related to the lack of Citizen’s Charter-related questions into our feedback forms since the Agency has no Citizen’s Charter yet in 2023. This document was only submitted in March 2024.  \n\n2. Finding no. 2 on the use of a different computation in measuring its CSM results. PhilSA, in good faith, utilized feedback forms that contains different terms or words when rating the service availed. Further, PhilSA did not include the term “not applicable” or “N/A” as answer to the form. By reason thereof, the Agency is constrained to modify the formula in order to incorporate the CMS results. \n\n3. Findings no. 5 and 6 on the inclusion of summary of the SQD 1-8 results and reflection of SQD 0. PhilSA may not be able to provide the said requirements since the Agency used in good faith a different feedback form.  \n\n Nonetheless, the Agency made the necessary revisions to the CSMR for C.Y. 2023 submission and is committed to implementing feedback forms that fully comply with ARTA regulations in subsequent submissions.  \n\nWe will be submitting our revised CSMR through the designated submission portal. Should you have any clarifications, please do not hesitate to reach out to our CART members with a copy furnished to the Space Policy and Legal Affairs Division at splad@philsa.gov.ph.  \n\n   \nThank you!
