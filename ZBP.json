Factors such as the overlap of procedural and actual services provided by the agency, identification of external and internal services towards its clients, as well as the entirety of streamlining efforts in areas such as processing and turnaround time are congruent to the entire mission of the authority, which aims to promote accountable and transparent government services and initiatives to reduce unchecked bureaucratic inefficiencies through the pursuit of the effective delivery of public goods and utilities.  \n\nTo comply with these directives, the Philippine Army has undertaken timely efforts to follow the deadline stipulated in the memorandum circular. With the prompt submission of these documentary requirements, there are certain complications encounter by the PA-ARTC such as; the existence of multiple entries in the CY 2021 Citizen’s Charter which can be considered as a form of clerical error, overlapping services that can be categorized into procedural and actual, the inclusion of Philippine Army Major Units (PAMUs) in the tally for services provided, as well as the removal of other services deemed unfit for the streamlining efforts for CY 2022. Such complications were expected to be smoothened out after the date of the submission itself, given that the validation from the authority shall serve as an enhancing mechanism to such efforts, which will eventually improve the accomplishment of reportorial requirements for the entire organization.\n\nWith these, the PA-ARTC will be submitting the documentary compliances to the Zero Backlog Program on 29 April 2022 in order to affirm to the directives warranted by the Anti-Red Tape Authority\n","Standardized Agency Name":"Philippine Army - Central Office","Submission Type":"AB","Telephone Number":86719673,"Timestamp":"2022-04-29 14:37:58.080000","Total number of pending transactions for the covered period ":"4","Total number of services (License, Clearance, Permit, Certification Authorization, and others)":"104","Total number of services with pending transactions for the covered period":"4","Unnamed: 24":null},{"1.

Training requests assessed by PAT with complete submission are processed by the CDD. As of 30 June 2023, there are 27 pending requests for PAT assessment, and 74 requests for CDD to process. As of 31 December 2023, there are 79 pending requests for CDD to process while 47 were processed.\n\n(2) E-mail Replies - Reason for delay or pending: Lack of manpower (assigned to respond to voluminous requests for Email Replies (ER), task is given to 1 employee starting 2nd Quarter of 2023, per Office Order 2023-054). Review process was also changed due to the reorganization, Team Leader (TL) position is vacant, assigned OIC-TL who has other review tasks has this added task. Issue spotting and determination if task is ER or Letter Replies, which leads to delay of the drafting by proper employee to do the ER.\n\n(3) Request for Policy Action (Agency or External Request) - For reporting to the GPPB on the first quarter of year 2024 - The endorsement of Delisted Items from PS-DBM Common-Use Supplies and Equipment received on 28 December 2023 by the SD.
